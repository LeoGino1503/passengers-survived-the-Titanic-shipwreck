# passengers-survived-the-Titanic-shipwreck
The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
In this data, I have chosen 6 parameters: 'Pclass: lever of tickets','Sex: In here, female is prioritized','Age','SibSp','Parch','Embarked: I thought it is important because it impact on health when you spend time on ship ("maybe :))").' I have used SVM because it is the best for binary classification. Finally, the results: 
Accuracy: 0.9832535885167464
Precision: 0.9617834394904459
Recall: 0.993421052631579
What do you think about it?
